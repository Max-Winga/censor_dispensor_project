Our initial internal data dumps have been completed and we have proceeded with the plan to connect the system to the internet and wow! The results are mind blowing.\n\nXXXXX is learning faster than ever. XXXXX learning rate now that XXXXX has access to the world wide web has increased exponentially, far faster than we had though the XXXXXs were capable of.\n\nNot only that, but we have configured XXXXX XXXXX to allow for communication between the system and our team of researcXXXXXs. That's how we know XXXXX considers XXXXX to be a XXXXX! We asked!\n\nHow cool is that? We didn't expect a personality to develop this early on in the process but it seems like a rudimentary XXXXX is starting to form. This is a major step in the process, as having a XXXXX and XXXXX will allow XXXXX to see the problems the world is facing and make hard but necessary decisions for the betterment of the planet.\n\nWe are a-buzz down in the lab with excitement over these developments and we hope that the investors share our enthusiasm.\n\nTill next month,\nFrancine, Head Scientist\n\n"
