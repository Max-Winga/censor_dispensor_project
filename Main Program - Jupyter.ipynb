Now, the system is learning faster than ever and we are hard pressed to continue to find new information to feed it and sustain its growth.\n\nSoon, we'll expand the scope of the ---------- and connect the system with the internet.

Famine, plague, war, and poverty are all conquerable with the power of our system!\n\nTill next month,\nFrancine, Head Scientist\n\n"
